# CS101 Coursework Repository

This repository contains programming assignments, practice problems, and code experiments for the CS101 course, organized week by week.

## Structure

- **week0 - week12/**: Each folder contains code files corresponding to that week's topics and assignments.
    - Most files are in C++ (`.cpp`), with some Python (`.py`)
    - Example topics include:
        - Basic C++ syntax and programs
        - Loops, conditionals, and functions
        - Recursion and sorting algorithms
        - Data structures (linked lists, trees)
        - String manipulation
        - Mathematical and combinatorial problems
        - Some exploratory scripts in Python 

## Notes

- Some folders contain compiled binaries (`a.out`). These can be ignored or deleted as needed.
- File names generally indicate the problem or concept (e.g., `fibonacci.cpp`, `bubblesort.cpp`, `battleRECURSION.cpp`).
- Some files may be incomplete or experimental.
